Rangel 2017: PAN 2017 Author Profiling Overview
	Best approaches used both style and contents of tweets
	Content:
		N-grams
		Word Dictionaries
	Style:
		Punctuation
		Part-of-Speech (POS)
		Twitter-specific elements: Hashtags, RT quotes, usernames
	Deep learning approaches: did not perform best
		Recurrent Neural Nets (RNNs)
		Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
		Word/character embeddings

Basile 2017 : N-GrAM

	1st place at PAN 2017
		Best at gender ID task in English and Spanish
	System:
		Simple SVM (Used Scikit-learn: linearSVM)
		Features:
			3- to 5-grams for characters
			1- to 2-grams for words
		TF-IDF Weighting
		sublinear term frequency scaling
			used 1 + log(tf) instead of standard term frequency
		single parameter set for all languages and both tasks
	Data: 
		11400 sets of tweets

Martinc 2017: NN-FT/U
	2nd place at PAN 2017
		Best at gender ID task in Arabic
	System:
		Logistic regression model: identical for all languages
		Features:
			N-Grams:	
				Word uni-, bi- and (bound character) tertr-gram
				Punctuation Trigrams
				Suffix Character tetragrams
			Other features:
				POS trigrams: used Part-of-Speech tags
				emoji counts
				Document sentiment
				Character flood counts
				Word lists: language variety specific
		TF-IDF weighting

Miura 2017:
	3rd place at PAN 2017 (Gender task)  
	2 models:
		NN-FT
			System:
				CNN, RNN
				Max pooling
				Attention Mechanism
			Features:
				Word Embeddings (w/ RNN)
				Character Embeddings (w/ CNN)
			Weight matrices
		NN-FU
			largely same as NN-Ft, but with different attention mechanism

Tellez 2017:
	4th place at PAN 2017 (Gender Task
	System:
		SVM CLassifier (liblinear)
		Features:
			word n-grams (n= 1,2,3)
			character nb-grams (n= 1,3,5,7,9)
			skipgrams
		Weighting scheme: TF-IDF
